## Security zones

Secure zones allow us to logically separate devices on our network by their use or access type.

Each area is associated with a zone
- Trusted, untrusted
- Internal, External
- Inside, Internet, Servers, Databases, Screened

 This simplifies security policies
 - Trusted to Untrusted
 - Untrusted to Screened
 - Untrusted to Trusted
