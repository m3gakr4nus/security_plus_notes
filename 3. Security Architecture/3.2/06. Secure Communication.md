## VPNs

- Virtual Private Network
- Encrypt private data traversing a public network
- Often managed by a VPN **Concentrator**
	- Purpose built device
	- VPN endpoint

#### Encrypted tunnel
- The **IP Header** and **Data** are encrypted
- To identify where the encrypted data begins and end two frames are added
	- **IPsec Headers** at the beginning of the encrypted data
	- **IPsec Trailers** at the end of the encrypted data
- To know where the packet must go, a new **IP Header** is added

## Selection of effective controls

- VPN
	- SSL/TLS VPN for user access
	- IPsec tunnels for site-to-site access
- SD-WAN
	- Manage the network connectivity to the cloud
	- Does not adequately address security concerns
- SASE
	- A complete network and security solution
	- Requires planning and implementation
