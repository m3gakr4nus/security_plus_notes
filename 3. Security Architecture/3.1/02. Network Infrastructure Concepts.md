## Physical isolation

- Devices are physically separate

## Logical segmentation with VLANs

Virtual Local Area Network (VLANs) are used to **logically** segment the network instead of **physically**

The VLANs wouldn't be able to communicate without a layer 3 device (router)

## SDN (Software Defined Networking)

There three planes called
- Data
- Control
- Management

The physical networking devices are broken down into their individual functions so that it is possible to create them as software.

- Infrastructure layer / Data plane: 
	- Process the network frames and packets
	- Switching, routing, forwarding, encrypting, trunking and NAT
- Control layer / Control plane: 
	- Manages the actions of the data plane
	- Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables
- Application layer / Management plane
	- Configure and manage the device
	- SSH, browser, API
