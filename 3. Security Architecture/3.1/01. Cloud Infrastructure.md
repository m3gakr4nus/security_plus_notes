## Hybrid clouds

It's the act of using multiple cloud **providers**. Note "providers" here and not cloud "instances".

This is done for better flexibility but adds onto the complexity.

### Network protection mismatch

This happens when the same components are configured differently between the cloud providers. Different cloud providers don't usually talk to each other so there is no way to be sure if everything is the same.

Missmatch can happen in areas such as:
- Authentication
- Firewall configuration
- Server settings

## Third-party vendors in the cloud

Sometimes there is a need to use third-party components such as firewalls and etc.

Having a **Vendor Risk Management Policy** is recommended.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Defines the infrastructure as code instead of hardware.
basically a script that sets up cloud instances.

This code can be used with different cloud vendors.

## Serverless architecture

Serverless technology helps developers to not worry about the underlying infrastructure and just focus on writing code.

Function as a Service (FaaS)

The application function are executed only when needed. When it's no longer necessary to run, it is removed from the cloud until next time.

## Microservices and APIs

Instead of having one large application (Monolithic application) which contained everything in one big file, we use APIs.

Application Programming Interce (API)s help us break down individual services for an application and run them as separate instances in the cloud. All the client needs to do is connect to the API Gateway which would then send the request to the appropriate microservice.
