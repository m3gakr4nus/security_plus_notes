## Definitions

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**: allows an organization to apply more strict security controls over accounts with elevated privileges, such as administrator or root-level accounts.
	- **just-in-time permissions**: administrators don’t have administrative privileges until they need them
- **Deprovisioning**: the process used to disable a user’s account when they leave the organization.
- **Privilege creep (permission bloat)**: occurs when a user is granted more and more privileges due to changing job requirements, but unneeded privileges are never removed.
- **Attestation**: a formal process for reviewing user permissions. managers formally review each user’s permissions and certify that those permissions are necessary.

### Time-based logins (time-of-day restrictions)
