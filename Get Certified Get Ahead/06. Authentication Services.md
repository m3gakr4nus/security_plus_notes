## Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

- An XMLâ€“based data format used for SSO on web browsers
- Two organizations who trust each other can use SAML as a federated identity management System

#### SAML defines three roles
- **Principal**: Typically a user who only logs on ONCE. If necessary, the principal requests an identity from the identity provider.
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: creates, maintains, and manages identity information, authentication, and authorization for principals.
- **Service Provider**: An entity that provides services to principals. For example, it queries the IdP to verify that the user has valid credentials before granting access.


## OAuth

Allow access to a system without giving away the password.

For example:
It's the windows that pops up and says the X service want to access Y and Z resources on your Google account.
