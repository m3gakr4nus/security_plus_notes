- **East-West Traffic**: Traffic between servers. Because in Network diagrams, servers are put side-by-side. Client are shown below or above servers so that would be north-south.

- **Forward Proxy server**: Forwards traffic for clients
- **Reverse proxy**: Accepts requests from the Internet for a web server. To end users, it appears as a web server but it is forwarding the requests to the server.

- **Unified threat management (UTM)**: UTM device will reduce the workload of administrators without sacrificing security.
	- URL Filtering
	- Malware inspection
	- Content inspection
	- DDoS mitigator

- **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)**: focus on implementing strong authentication systems and then creating policy-driven access controls based upon a user’s identity instead of their system’s location.

- **Control plane**: The communications used to configure and control the network
	- **Policy Engine (PE):** decides whether to grant access to a resource for a given subject.
	- **Policy Administrator (PA)**: responsible for communicating the decisions made by the PE to the tools on the network
	- **Policy Decision Point (PDP)**: PE + PA
- **Data plane**: The communication between users and softwares on a network
	- **The Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**: the only system allowed to cross planes boundary because it must receive instructions from the Policy Administrator on the control plane and then enforce those instructions on the data plane.

- **Secure access service edge (SASE)**: a design philosophy closely related to ZTNA. a broader philosophy that builds upon zero-trust and adds additional security services, including:
	- Firewall services
	- Secure web gateway services
	- Anti-malware services
	- Intrusion prevention services
	- Cloud access service broker services
	- Data loss prevention services
