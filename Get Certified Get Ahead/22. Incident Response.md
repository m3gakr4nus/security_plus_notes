**Incident Response Plan:** It provides organizations with a formal, coordinated plan that personnel can use when responding to an incident.

**Incident Response Phases**
1. Preparation (Before an incident - IR policy and plan)
2. Detection (Monitoring traffic - SIEM)
3. Analysis (Confirm detected events)
4. Containment (Quarantining or removing devices from the network)
5. Eradication (Remove malware and clean up systems)
6. Recovery (Return all affected systems to normal operation)
7. Lessons Learned (modify procedures and add more controls)

**Threat hunting** is like being a detective in the digital world. It’s when skilled computer security experts actively search for sneaky cyber threats that might have slipped past regular security systems.

**Order of volatility** refers to the order in which you should collect evidence. Volatile doesn’t mean it’s explosive, but rather that it is not permanent.

Most to least volatile:
- Cache
- RAM
- Swap file or pagefile
- Disk
- Attached devices
- Network

**Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)**: SOAR tools respond automatically, which frees up administrators to focus on other administrative and cybersecurity tasks.

**Playbooks**: a playbook provides general guidelines
**Runbooks**: a runbook provides the technical details to implement the playbook guidelines
