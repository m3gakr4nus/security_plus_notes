- **Full tunnel:** Redirect ALL traffic through the VPN
- **Split tunnel**: Redirect only specific traffic through the VPN such as traffic meant for remote internal systems
## Authentication Models

- **Password Authentication Protocol (PAP):**  is used with **Point- to-Point Protocol (PPP)** to authenticate clients. A significant weakness of PAP is that it sends passwords over a network in cleartext, representing a considerable security risk.

- **Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)**: also uses PPP and authenticates remote users, but it is more secure than PAP.

- **Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)**: a centralized authentication service. Instead of each individual VPN server needing a separate database to identify who can authenticate, the VPN servers forward the authentication requests to a central RADIUS server.

- **Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+)**: is an alternative to RADIUS. First, it encrypts the entire authentication process, whereas RADIUS encrypts only the password by default. Second, TACACS+ uses multiple challenges and responses between the client and the server.
