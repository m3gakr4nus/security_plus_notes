**Sender Policy Framework (SPF)**

Uses DNS records to define which IP addresses are authorized to send emails **on behalf of a domain**.

**Domain-Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)**

Uses public key cryptography to sign and verify an email's domain and content.

**Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)**

builds on top of SPF and DKIM by allowing domain owners to set policies for how to handle emails that fail authentication checks and providing reporting mechanisms to monitor and improve email authentication performance.

**Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)**

delivers audio and video over IP networks. This includes Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications, streaming media, video teleconferencing applications, and devices using web-based push-to-talk features. However, organizations often want to secure these transmissions.

The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides encryption, message authentication, and integrity for RTP.

**Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)**

Used to initiate, maintain, and terminate voice, video, and messaging sessions. SIP uses request and response messages when establishing a session. After SIP establishes the session, RTP or SRTP transports the audio or video.
