## Access Control Types

**Role-Based Access Control**

Administrators create roles and assign permissions to these roles. Then they add users to these rolls. The users will inherit the rights and permissions from the role. Like Security Groups in Windows.
  
**Rule-Based Access Control**

Uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to allow or deny access. Such as in Firewalls and routers.
  
**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**

Objects such as files and folders have owners. The owners decide who has what access over the objetcs. Most Unix and Windows systems (NTFS) use this scheme.
Windows uses Security Identifiers (SIDs) to identifiy users and groups. Every object on the file system has a Discretionary Access Control List (DACL). This list defines who can access the object in the system.

**Mandetory Access Control (MAC)**

Uses `sensitivity lables` to grant or block access. Both the subject (user) and the object (file or folder) must have the same label.
Widely used in military --> "Top Secret" label on the object and "Top Secret clearance" label on the subject.

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
Uses attributes to grant or block access. A subject may have the attributes "employee" or "manager" or both.
Commonly used in Software-defined Networks (SDNs).
