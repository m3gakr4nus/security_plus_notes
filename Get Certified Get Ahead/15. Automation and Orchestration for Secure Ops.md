**User provisioning**: Automating the process of creating, updating, and removing user accounts and permissions ensures that access control is maintained efficiently and securely. This can help prevent unauthorized access and maintain the principle of least privilege.

**Resource provisioning**: Automation can be used to create, configure, and decommission resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networks. This helps maintain a standardized, secure environment while reducing the potential for human error and configuration drift.

**Guardrails**: Automated guardrails can be put in place to enforce security policies and ensure that security best practices are consistently followed throughout the organization.
