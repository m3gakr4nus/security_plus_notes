# Scalability and Elasticity

- **Scalability**: Increase the capacity of a system or server to handle the load. Unlike elasticity, scalability is done manually.
	- Adding additional servers for example

- **Elasticity**: Adding more resources in high-demand times and removing those added resources to less-demand times.
	- Unlike Scalability, you can move up and down.

- **Horizontal scaling** (Scale out): Adding more device/servers to handle the load.
- **Vertical scaling** (Scale up): Adding more resources such as memory or processing power to individual devices.

- **Resiliency**: systems heal themselves or recover from faults with minimal downtime
