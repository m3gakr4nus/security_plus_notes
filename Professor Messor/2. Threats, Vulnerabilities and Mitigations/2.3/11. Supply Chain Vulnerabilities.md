## Overview

The process of getting raw materials, supplying, manufacturing, distribution, consumption is called the Supply chain.

An attacker can infect any step along the way. One exploit can infect the entire chain.

## Service providers

Service providers are responsible for the security of systems. If attackers gain access to the service provider, they will have access to our data as well.

Many different service providers such as:
- Network
- Utility
- Office cleaning
- Payroll/Accounting
- Cloud services
- System administration

Ongoing security audits are recommended.

## Hardware providers

Newly bought hardware such as firewalls, routers and switches could have been infected during the supply chain process.

Using a small supplier base is recommended. Ensure proper security is in place.

## Software providers

Every software installation requires out trust.

Digital signatures should be confirmed during the installation. Some software updates are automatic which can be dangerous since no visibility is available.
