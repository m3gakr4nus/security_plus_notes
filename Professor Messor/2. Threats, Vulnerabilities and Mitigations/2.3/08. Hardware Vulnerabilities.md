## Overview

We are surrounded by hardware devices. Many of them don't give us access to the OS inside. But since they are connected to the network, they are a potential security risk.

- Light bulbs
- Garage doors
- Refrigerators
- Door locks

And in generall IoT devices are an example of this.

## Firmware

The OS running inside these devices is called the firmware. The only people who can manage it is the vendor and the manufacturer itself.

Many manufacturer take a long time to releases patches if they even release them at all.

## End-of-life (EOL)

Manufacturers will give notice to customers that a device is not supported anymore from date X. They may continue supporting the product.

## End of service life (EOSL)

Manufacturers stop selling the product and no more support is given. No ongoing security patches are released and the devices need to be replaced.

## Legacy platforms

Some devices remain installed for a long time. Legacy devices usually run old OS, applications and middleware. The risk of using these devices further should be assessed and further decision made.
