## Overview

Malware runs in memory. The memory contains running processes such as:
- DLLs
- Threads
- Buffers
- Memory management functions
- and much more

The malware can choose to run as its own process **or inject itself** into an already running legitimate process.

Injecting itself can help with evasion and the malware will have the same rights and access to the system as the process which got injected.

## DLL injection

Dynamic-Link-Library (DLL) are a library of code and data which many applications can use on an operating system.

 1. The attacker will first get a malicious DLL on the system
 2. A link to the malicious DLL's path is then put inside a running process.
 3. The process will reach a point which it needs to reference that path.
 4. The process will pull-in that malicious DLL and execute it.
