## Overview

Updates often include bug fixes and security patches. The update process has its own security concerns. Attacker can inject their malicious code and embed it within the malicious code itself.

Users should have backups before updating and check the updates every time. Confirm the source of the update and ideally get the update from the developer's site. 

Checking the digital signatures of the update files is also recommended.

Many applications install updates in the app itself. It often includes security checks and it is relatively trustworthy.

However, this process is not a 100% grantee since it can be compromised through a supply-chain attack.
