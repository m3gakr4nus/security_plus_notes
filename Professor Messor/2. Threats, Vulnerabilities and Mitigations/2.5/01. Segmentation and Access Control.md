## Segmenting the network

Physical, logical or virtual segmentation can be used.
- Physical: Different devices
- Logical: VLANs
- Virtual: Virtual networks in the cloud for example

## Access control lists (ACLs)

Allow or disallow traffic based on
- Source IP
- Destination IP
- port number
- time of day
- application
- etc.

It can simply be based on IP addresses where only certain IP addresses can access a device on the network.

## Application allow/deny list

Many OSs let users create these lists to ensure only legitimate applications can be used.

Security policies are used to control app execution.

Configuring these lists can be done using either the application name or the application's hash. It can also make sure only digitally signed apps are running.
