## Overview

Attacker will pretend they are someone who they aren't. They will impersonate the victim's boss, help desk, IT team and so on. They would also throw tons of technical details and big words to get you thinking of what they're saying rather then if the message is fake or not.

## Eliciting information

This is the process of extracting information from the victim. Attacker will phish for information that would not be normally accessible without the victim realizing that something is happening.

Often seen with Vishing since it's easier and faster to extract information.

## Identity fraud

Attacker will use victim's personal information to impersonate them for things like getting a credit card with the victim's information. They can also open bank account under victim's information. The account can then be used for loans.

Identity fraud can also be used to get government benefits.
