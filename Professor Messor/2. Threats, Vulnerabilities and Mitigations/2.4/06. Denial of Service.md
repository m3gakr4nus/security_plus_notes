## Overview

Forcing a service to fail. 
- Overloading the service
- Using a know vulnerability or design failures

They are sometimes used to create distraction and exploit some other vulnerability elsewhere.

It doesn't have to be a complicated attack, simply turning off the power is a form of DoS.

## Friendly DoS

Unintentional DoSing.

Examples:
- Network DoS: Layer 2 loop without STP
- Bandwidth DoSL Downloading multi-gigabye files over a DSL line

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

Attackers will use a large number of devices all around the world (Botnets) to launch an attack on a target.

## DDoS reflection and amplification

Attacker will use internet services against a target. Sending small amount of data to these service will give you back more data.

Internet services with little to no authentication or checks such NTP, DNS and ICMP are used in these attacks. Attackers will send a request to these requests with the source IP address spoofed to be the victim's IP address so that the results of the request gets sent to the victim.
