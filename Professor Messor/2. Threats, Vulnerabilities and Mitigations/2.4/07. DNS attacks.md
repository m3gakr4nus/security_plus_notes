## DNS poisoning

Pointing domain names to malicious attacker-controlled servers.

This is done by
- **Modifying the DNS server**: Very hard to do and doesn't happen that often
- **Modifying the client hosts file**: The host file takes precedent over DNS queries.
- **MiTM**: Sending a fake response to valid DNS requests. Acting as a DNS server in the network.
## Domain hijacking

Attacker will try and get access to the domain registration and point the domain to a attacked-controlled IP address.

This is hard to do but it can be done through
- Brute force
- Social engineering
- Gain access to the email address that manages the account

## URL hijacking

Using a URL that is spelled similarly to the actual thing to host phishing sites, malware and/or redirections to another page.

- Typosquatting / Brandjacking
