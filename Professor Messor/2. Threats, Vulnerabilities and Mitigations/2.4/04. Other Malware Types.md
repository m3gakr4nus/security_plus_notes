## Keyloggers

Keystrokes are captured
- Website login URLs
- passwords
- email messages

All of this information is saved and sent to the attackers.

They can also be used to:

## Logic Bomb

It waits for a predefined event such as a certain date/time or certain user activity such as logins.

## Rootkits

Originally a Unix technique.

It modifies core system files such as the kernel. It is invisible to the OS, Antivirus and the user. 

**Secure boot** will first check for an OS signature and make sure that no system files are modified before booting. This can prevent rootkits from working even if they are installed.
