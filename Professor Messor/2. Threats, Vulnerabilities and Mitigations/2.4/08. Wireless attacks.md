## Wireless deauthentication

This is a form of DoS attack that disconnects users from the network.

This is done by taking advantage of vulnerabilities inside the **802.11 management frames**.

These frames are used to
- Connect devices to a network
- Manage the connection
- Disconnect the device from a network

IEEE has fixed this in 802.11ac

Management frames such has Disassociate, deauthenticate and channel switch announcement are now encrypted.

Other management frames such as Beacons, probes, authentication and association are not encrypted because they need to be in the clear.

## RF Jamming

Another form of DoS attack which will decrease the signal-to-noise ratio at the reviving device. Since the receiving device can't hear any good signal, it will not be able to use the network.

Sometimes it happens unintentionally by using a Microwave or fluorescent lights.

## Wireless Jamming

This can be done through various ways such as:
- Sending constant amount of information
- Sending random data across the network
- Sending large legitimate frames across the network

These data are sent at random times so it is harder to troubleshoot.

Reactive jamming is done to avoid jamming when the network is quite and more jamming is done when network activity is detected.

### Fox hunting

A fox hunter device can show from which direction certain signals are coming from. This can be used to find the device causing the jamming.
