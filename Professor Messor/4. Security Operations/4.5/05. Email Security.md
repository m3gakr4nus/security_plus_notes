## DMARC

- Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
	- A extention of SPF and DKIM
	- The domain owner decides what receiving email servers should do with emails not validating using SPF and DKIM
	- This is done by adding a DNS TXT record
	- Accept all, send to spam or reject the email
