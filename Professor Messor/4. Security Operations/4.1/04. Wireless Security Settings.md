## WPA3

To get rid of WPA2 PSK attack, SAE is used.

**Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**
- A Diffie-Hellman derived key exchange with an authentication component
- Everyone uses a different session key, even with the same PSK
- An IEEE standard, dragonfly handshake
- No more four-way handshake, no more hash and nothing to bruteforce

## Wireless security modes

- **Open system**: NO authentication
- **WPA3-Personal / WPA3-PSK**: Uses a single password
- **WPA3 Enterprise / WPA3-802.1X**: Authenticates users individually


## RADIUS

- Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)
- Centralized authentication for users
	- Routers, switches, firewalls
	- Server authentication
	- Remote VPN access
	- 802.1X network access

## IEEE 802.1X

- Port-based Network Access Control (NAC)
- No access until authenticated
- Used in conjuction with RADIUS, LDAP and etc.

## EAP

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
- An authentication framework
- Can be customized
- Commonly integrated with 802.1X
