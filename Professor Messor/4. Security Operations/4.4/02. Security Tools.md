## Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)

- Managed by NIST (http://scap.nist.gov)
- Different tools might use different words and definitions to describe the same vulnerability
	- SCAP allows tools to identify and act on the same criteria
	- Different tools can then start working together


## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- Stopping sensitive data being transferred through the network
	- SSN, Credit card info or any other data
- Stop the data before the attacker gets it

## SNMP

- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
	- A database of data (MIB) - Management Information Base
	- The database contains OIDs - Object Identifiers
	- Poll devices over udp/161
- A network management station polls another device for information

#### SNMP Trap

- To get alerts when a specific event happens, we can use SNMP traps
- SNMP Traps are configured on the monitored device
	- Communicates over udp/162
- Once the event occures, a trap is sent to the management system
- The management system then sets of alarms

## NetFlow

- Standard collection method
- Monitoring traffic flows and statics of application use

- Probe and collector
	- Probe watches network communication
	- Summary records are sent to the collector
