## Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

An authentication framework. Used with both wired and wireless devices.

Most common integration is **802.1X** which prevents access to the network until the authentication succeeds

#### IEEE 802.1X

- Port-based Network Access Control (NAC): Simply connecting to a a port will not give you access to the network unless you authenticate.

Three separate components are involved here
- **Supplicant**: End user, client
- **Authentication**: Switch or AP
- **Authentication** **server**: Active directory, RADUIS or whatever

#### The authentication process
