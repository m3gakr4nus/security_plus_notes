## Network-based firewall

Filter traffic by port number or application.

Traditional firewalls operate on layer 4 (TCP/UDP). Next-generation Firewall (NGFW) operate on layer 7 (application), which means they can control traffic based on software.

- Firewalls can allow VPN connections to the network
- Can operate on layer 3 and act as a router
	- NAT functionality

## UTM / All-in-one security appliance

Unified Threat Management (UTM) / Web security gateway can handle many different services all at once.
- URL filter / Content inspection
- Malware inspection
- Spam filter
- CSU/DSU
- Router, Switch
- Firewall
- IDS/IPS
- Bandwidth shaper
- VPN endpoint

Many of these device only operate on layer 4 (port numbers) and they can have bad performance if all functionalities are turned on.

## Next-generation firewall (NGFW)

These devices operate at layer 7.

They can be known by different names such as:
- Application layer gateway
- Stateful multilayer inspection
- Deep packet inspection

- Every packet is analyzed and categorized before a security decision is determined.
- They also apply application-specific vulnerability detection using signatures.
- They can be used to filter content
	- URL filters
	- Website traffic by category

## Web application firewall (WAF)

- Not like a "normal" firewall
- Allow or deny based on expected input (not packets or ports)
- A major focus of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
