## High availability

[[04. Infrastructure Considerations]]

## Server clustering

- Combine two or more servers
	- Appears and operates as a single large server
- Easily increase capacity
- Usually configured in the OS

## Site resiliency

- A recovery site is prepared
- Once a disaster happens, one switches to the backup site
	- This can be used for hours, weeks or longer
- Once the disaster is mitigated, one moves back to the original site

#### Hot site
- An exact replica of the data center
	- You always but 2 of everything
- Constantly updated
- Automated replication
- Flip a switch and everything moves to the backup site

#### Cold site
- No hardware (Empty building)
- No data
- No people

Everything should be brought to this place

#### Warm site

- Something between cold and hot
- Some hardware and some data but not enough

## Geographic dispersion

- These sites should be physically different than the organization's primary location
	- Protect against hurricane, tornado, floods and etc.
- Can be a logistical challenge
	- Transporting equipment
	- Getting employee's on-site
	- Getting back to the main office

## Continuity of operations planning (COOP)

- There needs to be an alternative to technology
	- Manual transactions
	- Paper receipts
	- Phone calls for transaction approvals
