## Quantitative risk assessment

- ARO (Annulized Rate of Occurence)
	- How often a risk will happen in a year?
- Asset Value
	- The value of the asset to the organization
	- Includes costs, effects on company sales, potential fines
- Exposure factor (EF)
	- The percentage of the value lost due to in incident
	- Losing a quarter of the asset, EF is 0.25
	- Losing the entire asset, EF is 1.0

#### SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
- What is the monetary loss if a single event occurs?
- Asset Value (AV) x Exposure factor (EF) = SLE

#### ALE (Annulized Loss Expectancy)
- Annualized Rate of Occurance (ARO) x SLE = ALE
