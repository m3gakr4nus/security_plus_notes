## Honeypots

A way to attract attackers to systems and trap them in there. Then one would monitor them and see what attacks are they using or what systems are they trying to attack.

#### Honeynets

A network includes multiple devices. To make honeypots more realistic, multiple honeypots are created and connected to each other.

#### Honeyfiles

Attractive files for attackers with fake information inside them.
For example: `passwords.txt`

An alert is sent once the file is accessed.

#### Honeytokens

Adding traceable data to honeynets so if attackers copy and share the information, it could be traced.
