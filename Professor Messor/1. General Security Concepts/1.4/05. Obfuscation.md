## Obfuscation

Making data more difficult to understand but not impossible to do so.
The information is basically hidden in plain sight.


## Steganography

**"Security through obsecurity"**
For example, data is hidden within an image.

If you figure out how the data was stored, then you can reverse the process and extract the data.

**Common steganography techniques**
- **Network based**: Embed messages within the TCP packet
- **Use an image**: Embed the message in the image itself i.e. inside the pixels
- **Invisible watermarks:** Yellow dots on printers (Machine identification codes)

## Tokenization

Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder

For example, changing the social security numbers to completely different numbers and transfer it across the network.
On the other side, it will be reverted back to the original SSN.

**Common with credit card processing**
- An attacker capturing the card numbers can't use them later
- This isn't hashing or encryption

## Data masking

Data obfuscation through hiding parts of the information.

Many different techniques:
- Substituting, shuffling, encrypting masking out
