## Overview

A certificate is a public key with a digital signature. It also includes other information about the key holder.

A digitial signature adds trust.

A certificate is first created by the key holder, then the CA (Certificate Authority) signs the certificate. After that, if the CA trusts that certificate, then others will trust it as well.

### Web of Trust

Instead of having a centralized CA, we can have multiple individuals sign each other's certificates.

If we trust our friend, and they've trusted a third party, we will also trust that third party.

### Digital Certificates

**X.509** is the standard format.

Certificate details:
- Serial number
- Version
- Signature algorithm
- Issuer
- Name of the cert holder
- Public key
- Extentions
- and more...

## Root of Trust

How to build trust from something unknown?
- Someone or something will vouch for the unknown thing
- This is called the **Root of trust**.

The root of trust can be anything such as:
- Hardware
- Software
- Firmware
- or other components

For mobile phones and websites:
- Hardware security modules (HSM)
- Secure Enclave
- CA

## Certificate Authority

A good way to trust an unknown entity is to use a **trusted third-party** or an **Authority**.

A **CA** would sign certificates for websites and in doing so, browsers will automatically trust those websites.

Trusted Certificate Authorities are pre-built into the browser. (There are hundreds)

### Signing process

1. Create a key pair, then send the public key to the CA to be signed. This is called a **CSR** **(Certificate Signing Request)**
2. The CA will validate the request, confirms DNS emails and website ownership.
3. If everything looks good, the CA will sign the certificate with their Private Key.
4. The digitally signed certificate is then returned to the applicant.

### Private CAs

If there's no need for people outside of an organization to trust our certificates, a private internal CA can be implemented. The devices inside the organization would trust this CA.
- This is done by installing a CA software.
- Then, installing the CA's public certificate on all devices inside the network

Some examples of private CAs:
- Windows Certificate Services
- OpenCA

This is also known as a "Self-signed Certificate". Devices outside the organisation (the ones that don't have the internal CA's public certificate) will not trust these certificates.

### Wildcard Certificates

Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or wildcard certificates allow us to use the name of domains and a wildcard on the devices associated with that domain.

Example `*.google.com` or `*.youtube.com`

This mean the certificate can be used for any device that happens to share that fully qualified domain name (FQDN) listed in the SAN.

## Key revocation

Sometimes we would like the certificate to not be valid anymore or if an attacker gains access to these certificates we would like to revoke them.

Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of all revoked certificates which is kept on the CA itself.

In April 2014 a vulnerability was discovered that allowed attacker to gain the webserver's private key.
- `CVE-2014-0160`
- This is called the "Heartbleed" attack.
This was due to a vulnerability in OpenSSL which was patched later on.

All of the old certificates needed to be revoked and replaced with new ones.

### OCSP stapling

It is not efficient to keep all revocations in a single file, going to a CA and downloading a huge list.

**Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)** was created to make the process more efficient.
- Revoked certificates are stored on the certificate holder's own server.
- The certificate holder is responsible to verify the status of their certificates.
- Status messages of the certificate are sent during the SSL handshake process. This is called OCSP stapling.

We can't trust a server to truthfully tell us if a certificate is valid or not. That is why the OCSP uses a digital signature by the CA to validate its status.

Most browsers will take care of all of this process but not all of them support OCSP.
- Early Internet Explorer version
Some also support OCSP but don't really bother to check! Checking the browser is recommened.
