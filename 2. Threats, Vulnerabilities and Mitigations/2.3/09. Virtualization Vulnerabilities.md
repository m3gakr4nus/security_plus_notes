## VM escape protection

The virtual machine is self-contained meaning it is not possible to jump around from the VM to the host or other VMs.

However some vulnerabilities inside the Hypervisor allow attackers to do exactly that.

## Resource reuse

The hypervisor manages the relationship between physical and virtual ressources.

The resources can be reused between VMs. At certain times, certain parts of a shared resource such as a memory are shared between VMs. If the Hypervisor is vulnerable, it's possible to exploit this sharing and gain access to other VMs.
