## Overview

Attackers are able to overwrite a buffer of a memory. If an application allows writing of more than the bytes reserved for a memory buffer, attacker will be able to execute malicious code.

This is not an easy vulnerability to exploit.

**Before Overflow:**

**After Overflow:**
"excessive" is written to variable "A" but the last character 'e' has been written to variable "B" since var. "A" can only hold 8 characters and last character gets overflown into the next section in memory.
