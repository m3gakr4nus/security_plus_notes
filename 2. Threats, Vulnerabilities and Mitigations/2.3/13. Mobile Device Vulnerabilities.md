## Jailbreaking / Rooting

Mobile devices are purpose-built systems and they do not give access to the operating system.

Rooting on Android and Jailbreaking  iOS devices replaces the existing operating system with a third-party version. This is done to enable new features.

If this happens, it would circumvent security features. The Mobile Device Manager (MDM) becomes relatively useless.

## Sideloading

Malicious apps are installed on these devices.

Managing installation sources is a good idea to prevent this from happening.
