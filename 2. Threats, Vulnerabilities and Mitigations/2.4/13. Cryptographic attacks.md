## Birthday attack

Hash collisions happen when two different clear text data generate identical hashes. Finding these are done through brute-force methods.

## Downgrade attack

Attackers will force devices to use a weaker encryption method that can be easily broken or not use any encryption at all.

### SSL Stripping

Combines an on-path attack with a downgrade attack.

Attackers will sit in the middle of the conversations and force the victim to use HTTP rather than HTTPS.
