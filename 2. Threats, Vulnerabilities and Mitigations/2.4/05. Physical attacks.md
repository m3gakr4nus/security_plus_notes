## Brute force

The physical version is pushing through the obstruction.
- Breaking windows
- Breaking down doors

## RFID Cloning

Access badges and key fobs use RFID.

Attackers will clone these badges and use them to get into places.

Duplicators are available for less than $50 on Amazon. The duplication process takes seconds to complete. Read the card -> write to another

Using MFA is a good idea here.

## Environmental attacks

If attackers can not attack the systems directly, they will try to attack the environment around the systems.

- **Power monitoring**: Turning off the power
- **HVAC(Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) and humidity controls**: Turning off coolers can make the systems overheat.
- **Fire suppression**: can be used to perform DoS.
