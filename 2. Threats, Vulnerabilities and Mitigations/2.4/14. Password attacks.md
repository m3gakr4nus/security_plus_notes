## Spraying attack

Attackers will use a common passwords list and try to guess your password. The attack will only guess 1-2 times a day to avoid lockouts.

## Brute force

Attackers will try every possible combination until the hash is matched.

This will take a lot of time.

Online brute force attacks are extremely slow and will cause lock outs.
