## Overview

A term to describe social engineering with a touch of spoofing. It is often delivered by email and text.

Checking the URL inside the message is essential to identifying whether it's a phishing or not. Sometimes there's something not quite right such as grammatical errors, weird fonts and graphics.

## Business email compromise

Attackers spoof email addresses either by spoofing an actual email address or by sending phishing emails using similar domain names.

Gaining access to an email account would allow them to impersonate the owner of that account. It will also allow them to do Password-reset.

## Tricks and misdirection

- **Typosquatting**: A type of URL hijacking. Using similar domain names to the target domain.
- **Pretexting**: Lying and making up a story to get information.

## Types of Phishing

### Vishing (Voice Phishing)

### Smishing (SMS Phishing)
