## Proof of integrity

- We can verify the data is redundant and unchanged.
- In cryptography hashes (a.k.a. message digest) are used to represent data as a short string of text
	- If a single byte changes, the hash will be completely different

## Proof of origin

Authentication is used to verify the source of the message. Using a digital signature makes sure that the message really did come from the intended sender.

- In cryptography, a private key is used to sign/encrypt the message/data.

- The other party will use the sender's public key to decrypt the message and verify the sender
