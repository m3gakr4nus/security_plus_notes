## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

- A chip on modern motherboards that will provide cryptographic functions to that computer.
- Cryptographic processor: Random number generator, key generator
- Persistent memory: Unique keys burned in during manufacturing used for example full disk encryption
- Versatile memory: Different keys are stored in the TPM.
	- No brute-force or password attack is possible

## Hardware Security (HSM)

Used in large environments such as data centers.

**HSM** provides a safe storage place for the keys used by the thousands of computers in the cluster

## Key management system

**Centralized key management system**
- On-premis or cloud
- Can manage all keys from one single management console
- Can create keys for a specific service (SSL/TLS, SSH, etc.)
- Can rotate keys on regular intervals
- Log key usage and important events

## Security enclave

A separate built-in processor specifically designed for privacy.
It helps to keep information private even if the device falls into unauthorized hands.
- It has its own boot ROM
- Monitors the system process and boot process
- True random number generator
- Real-time cryptographic keys
