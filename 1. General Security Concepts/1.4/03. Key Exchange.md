## Out-of-band key exchange

Exchange the key with some other method and not the insecure network.
- Telephone, courier, in-person

## In-band key exchange

The key is exchanged on the insecure network.
- An asymmetric encryption is used to deliver the symmetric key

## Symmetric key from asymmetric keys

1. Bob would combine his private key with Alice's public key to make a new symmetric key
2. Alice will combine her private key with Bob's public key to make the same new symmetric key
3. Since the keys are mathematically related, they will both end up with the same symmetric key
