## Hashes

- A message digest/fingerprint.
- Hashes are representations of data as a short string of text. It's not reversible like encryption.
- It is used to verify downloaded documents, can be used as a digital signature which is used for authentication, non-repudiation and integrity

## Hash collisions

Hash collision happens when the message digest of two or more different data is the same.
- Different input should always generate different output and never be the same output

Doesn't happen very often. **MD5** did have problems with collisions and it is now deprecated.

## Hashing usage
- Verify file integrity
- Password storage
- Digital signatures

## Digital Signatures

- Proves the message was not changed (Integrity)
- It also proves the source of the message (Authentication)

Digital signatures are generated by private-keys. The other party confirms the private-key by the sender's public-key.
